	- JCF is a implementation of generic programming in Java.
	
	
	class Student {
		int roll_number;
		String name;
	}
	
	LinkedList<Student> student = new LinkedList<Student>();
	
	
	
	NewForm<Student> student = new NewForm<Student>();
	NewForm<Employee> student = new NewForm<Employee>();
	
	
	Find some situations where generic classes may be implemented.
	
	
	class Student<T> {
		T roll_number;
		T name;
	}
	
	Containers (class)	-	contains data
	Algorithms (function)
	Iterators (Class)
	
	new, delete
	malloc, free
	
	int arr[20];
	
	arr[0]	=	base_address
	arr[1]	=	base_address + 1 * 4
