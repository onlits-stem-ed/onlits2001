	You are playing a game where you have an initial number of
	experience points. There are a total of n quests available to
	complete.

	• Each quest requires a minimum amount of experience points to
	start.

	• Upon completing a quest, you gain a certain amount of experience
	points.

	Consider a case where you have x experience points, you can
	complete any quest that requires <=x experience points to start 
	and hence gain more experience points as a result of completing that
	quest.

	However, you only have enough time to complete most k quests. 
	Your goal is to determine the maximum number of experience points
	you can accumulate.

	Example 1:

	Input:
	n=5

	intial_exp 10

	exp_req= [3,2,4,1,2]

	exp gain [5,3,6,2,4]

	k = 3

	Output:

	25
	
	
	You are given a binary array arr of size N consists of 0 and 1. 
	It arr[i]=0 then there is a white stone present at the index i and
	 if arr[i]=1 then there is a black stone preset at the index i

	You have infinite no of boxes of size K and you need to separate
	 white and black stones by putting them into different boxes. Find
	 the minimum no of box require to separate white and black stones
	 by putting them into different boxes.

Note: You cannot put more than K stones in a single box.

Example 1:

Input:

N = 4, K = 2 arr[] = {1,0,1,0)

Output: 2

Sclave Solution E

int separatestows I code here

Explanation: We can put first and third black stones into 1st box and second and fourth white stones into 2nd box.

Example 1:

Input:

N=5, K = 2

arr[] (1,1,1,1,1)

Output: 3
